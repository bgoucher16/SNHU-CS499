**Professional Self-Assessment**

I starting my journey a little over 4 years ago starting at Pierce Community College in Puyallup Washington. I started my major as a Health Information and Technology Major (HIT). The main languages that we focused on there were C#, Python, and HTML. Taking a look back at some of the code that I had written was astonishingly bad. Before getting my AA from there I transfered to SNHU and worked extremely hard in this program to be able to get to the end. Completely classes like Data Structures and Algorithms and Mobile Architecture and Programming which are typically seen as harder classes.
